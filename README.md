# Curriculum-Vitae
Personal projects from the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science 
### 1. Analog electronics
Semester project in which a customized circuit is studied through DC Sweep, PULSE and step response simulations
### 2. Computer architecture
- *First project - Multiplying sign numbers*
The project aims to familiarize with the notions of the Verilog language: modules, language constructions, the '' always '' combinational block, by implementing Booth's algorithm. A circuit is implemented that performs the multiplication of two integers (with sign), the numbers being taken from a two-digit digital display (2x seven-segment display).

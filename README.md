# Curriculum-Vitae
Personal projects from the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science 
### 1. Analog electronics
Semester project in which a customized circuit is studied through DC Sweep, PULSE and step response simulations
### 2. Computer architecture
- *First project - Multiplying sign numbers*
The project aims to familiarize with the notions of the Verilog language: modules, language constructions, the '' always '' combinational block, by implementing Booth's algorithm. A circuit is implemented that performs the multiplication of two integers (with sign), the numbers being taken from a two-digit digital display (2x seven-segment display).
- *Second project - Design of sequential circuits*
The project aims to practice working with the notions of Verilog used to design sequential circuits. The module will receive a data packet consisting of Header and Payload at the input. The header will contain information about what operation is to be performed on the ALU, and the number of words that will be received as payload. The operands will be received either in payload or will be read from memory through the AMM interface. The result will be placed on the output interface according to a specified structure
### 3. Databases
This project presents a human resources management tool used to hire people in companies. Implemented using the .NET (C #) framework for the interface and SSMS for the database connection, the application has the following functionalities:
- *Login interferface for users and admin*
- *Adding / deleting / modifying platform users*
- *SQL queries and sorting tables in the application*
### 4. Microprocessor systems
In this project, I wanted to make a device for gas and smoke detection, with alarm in case of fire using NodeMCU WiFi development board with ESP8266 and a Gas Sensor MQ-135. The following functionalities had to be implemented :
- *The device must be portable*
- *The device must have a visual alert mode (green and red LEDs)*
- *The device must have an audible alert mode (Buzzer)*
- *The device must be connected to my mobile phone and send me in real time the data sent by
sensor*
### 5. Programmable controllers and microprocessors
This project implemented in CoDeSys aims to simulate an automatic bread making process. The project has both the user interface and the block diagrams with the necessary steps for the manufacturing process.
### 6. Real-time application programming
In this applications I had as objective an implementation of a real-time application that will monitor the activity of a store. In my view, this concept store has three types of products, which are in stock in different quantities. The application wants to monitor the quantity of existing products in stock, following two scenarios:
a supply scenario in which the quantity of the desired products will increase and a purchase scenario in which, obviously, the quantity in stock of the desired products will decrease.
-**Both projects had the same theme but they are implemented in both C and Java language**

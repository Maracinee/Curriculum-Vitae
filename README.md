# Curriculum-Vitae
Personal projects from the Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science 
### 1. Analog electronics
Semester project in which a customized circuit is studied through DC Sweep, PULSE and step response simulations
### 2. Computer architecture
- *First project - Multiplying sign numbers*
The project aims to familiarize with the notions of the Verilog language: modules, language constructions, the '' always '' combinational block, by implementing Booth's algorithm. A circuit is implemented that performs the multiplication of two integers (with sign), the numbers being taken from a two-digit digital display (2x seven-segment display).
- *Second project - Design of sequential circuits*
The project aims to practice working with the notions of Verilog used to design sequential circuits. The module will receive a data packet consisting of Header and Payload at the input. The header will contain information about what operation is to be performed on the ALU, and the number of words that will be received as payload. The operands will be received either in payload or will be read from memory through the AMM interface. The result will be placed on the output interface according to a specified structure
